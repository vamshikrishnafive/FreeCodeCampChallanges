The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.

Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:

p:hover {
  transform: scale(2.1);
}
Note: Applying a transform to a div element will also affect any child elements contained in the div.

<style>
  div {
    width: 70%;
    height: 100px;
    margin:  50px auto;
    background: linear-gradient(
      53deg,
      #ccfffc,
      #ffcccf
    );
  }
  div:hover{
    transform:scale(1.1);
  }
</style>

<div></div>
