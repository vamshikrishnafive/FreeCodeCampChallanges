The last two challenges used the flex-direction property set to row. This property can also create a column by vertically stacking the children of a flex container.

Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its display property to grid. This gives you the ability to use all the other properties associated with CSS Grid.

Note: In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the container and its children are called items.

<style>
  .d1{background:LightSkyBlue;}
  .d2{background:LightSalmon;}
  .d3{background:PaleTurquoise;}
  .d4{background:LightPink;}
  .d5{background:PaleGreen;}
  .container {
    font-size: 40px;
    width: 100%;
    background: LightGray;
    /* Only change code below this line */
    display: grid;
    
    /* Only change code above this line */
  }
</style>

<div class="container">
  <div class="d1">1</div>
  <div class="d2">2</div>
  <div class="d3">3</div>
  <div class="d4">4</div>
